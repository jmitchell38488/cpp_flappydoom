# cpp_flappydoom

> [!NOTE]  
> This is pre-alpha stage game. There _are_ bugs. There will be performance issues and the game will slow down if you enable vsync or suffer a low framerate.

I have created my own version of FlappyDOOM in C++, inspired from the YouTube video [Doom styles Flappy Bird in Python][flappy-doom-py].

This project uses the [olcPixelGameEngine][pge] from [One Lone Coder (@javidx9)][yt].

This game has been made with the OLC 

See: [Linux DOOM][linux-doom].

Included libraries:

* [Mini Audio][ln-ma]
* [STB Image][ln-stb]
* [olcPGEX Font][ln-pgex-font]
* [olcPGEX MiniAudio][ln-pgex-ma]
* [olcPixelGameEngine][ln-pge]

### How to build
This project uses CMake for cross-platform support. Load the project into your favourite IDE and build!

From the CLI:

```bash
# compile it
cmake --build <build_path> --config Debug --target ALL_BUILD -j 14

# run it
build/bin/main<.ext>
```

The game has been tested on Linux, OSX & Windows 10. Make sure you bundle the assets along with the executable when compressing.

This game is _not_ optimized to run with [OLC Pixel Game Engine Mobile][olc-pgex-mobile]

### How to play
The game is composed of runs. A run is an attempt to navigate the gates. There are 5 difficulty levels, that affect the score the player receives for passing through a gate, and the speed the game plays at.

**Menu:**

* `UP/DOWN` arrow keys to navigate menu items
* `ENTER` to select a menu option
* `ESC` to select Quit/Main menu

The high scores menu won't appear until at least 1 run has been completed with a score.

**Game play:**

* `SPACEBAR` to start a new run and jump Flappy DOOM
* `ESCAPE` to show the game menu
* `ENTER` to pause the current run

Check `definitions.h` for enabling debug mode and full screen. Debug mode can be enabled by changing the bool `ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE` to `true` in `Settings.h`

Additional controls available during gameplay:

* `Q` to quit the game
* `D` to enter wireframe mode
* `P` to clamp the difficulty mode
* `O` to increase difficulty
* `I` to decrease difficulty
* `Y` to increase game speed step by difficulty 0.25f
* `T` to decrease game speed step by difficulty 0.25f
* `G` to increase pipe gap distance by 5.0f, capped at `BIRD_SH`
* `H` to decrease pipe gap distance by 5.0f, capped at `PIPE_GAP * 2`
